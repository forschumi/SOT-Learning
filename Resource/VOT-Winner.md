     | [**VOT2021**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/)  | RGBD | **STARK_RGBD**(STARK for the RGBD challenge)：This is a method combining STARK [[66](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yan_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Transformer_for_Visual_Tracking_ICCV_2021_paper.html)] and DiMPsuper [[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)]. STARK is a powerful transformer-based tracker with a siamese structure. We first change the backbone of STARK into DeiT [[57](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/touvron21a.html)]. The transformer-based backbone DeiT strengthens the feature of STARK. We notice the STARK method is not good at handling the appearance change of the target. To this end, we combine the DeiT-strengthened STARK with the DiMPsuper tracker, a powerful online updating tracker. Specifically, when the STARK tracker’s confidence is low or the prediction of STARK suddenly strays away, the DiMPsuper takes over the tracking process, providing a steady, appearance adaptive result. When the STARK’s confidence resumes, we switch back to STARK. We also design a refinement module similar to AlphaRefine [[67](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577854)] by modifying the search region of STARK. The refinement module is applied to the final output of the whole tracking system for further boosting the quality of box estimation. --From [《VOT2021 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/400)<br />**核心：[STARK算法](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yan_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Transformer_for_Visual_Tracking_ICCV_2021_paper.html)(ICCV2021)，结合[SuperDimp](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)算法，再利用[AlphaRefine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577854)修正结果。**|  
     | [**VOT2021**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/)  | LT | **mlpLT**(Fusing Complementary Trackers for Long-term Visual Tracking)： The idea behind the mlpLT tracker is to fuse the capabilities of different trackers. In particular, mlpLT implements a strategy that fuses the Stark [[66](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yan_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Transformer_for_Visual_Tracking_ICCV_2021_paper.html)] and SuperDiMP [[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)] trackers, which have been selected due to their complementary features. Indeed, the tracker Stark has been selected because of its ability to provide spatially accurate bounding-boxes, and to re-detect the target after disappearances. The meta-updater [[14](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)] controlled SuperDiMP was chosen due its robustness. The combination of such trackers is managed by a decision strategy based on an online learned target verifier [[50](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01225-0_6)]. At every frame, the trackers are run in parallel to predict their target localizations. Such outputs are checked by the verifier which quantifies how good the trackers are following the target. Based on such evaluations, the decision strategy selects which localization to give as output for the current frame. Such an outcome is also employed to correct the tracker that achieved the lowest performance according to the verifier. Additionally strategies such as the computation of adaptive search areas, and the avoidance of wrong target size estimations, have been implemented to the baseline trackers in order to make their localizations more consistent. --From [《VOT2021 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/400)<br />**核心：[STARK算法](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yan_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Transformer_for_Visual_Tracking_ICCV_2021_paper.html)(ICCV2021)，结合带[MU](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)的[SuperDimp](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)算法，在线[MDNet](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01225-0_6)分类器验证切换。**|     
     | [**VOT2021**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/)  | RT | **TransT_M**(Multi-Template Transformer Tracking)：TransT_M is a variant of TransT [[8](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578609/)]. We add a segmentation branch, a Multi-Template design, and an IoU prediction head on TransT, forming an end-to-end framework. We concatenate two templates in the spatial dimension, and input them into the template branch of TransT. IoU prediction head is a three-layer perceptron to predict the bounding box’s IoU and control the updating of the template. For details about TransT and the segmentation head, please refer to A.18.--From [《VOT2021 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/400)<br />**核心：[TransT算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578609/)，代表性的Transformer Tracking算法，孪生匹配架构，CNN提取特征，Transformer机制重合模板和搜索区域，发表于CVPR2021。**|
     | [**VOT2021**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2021/)  | ST | **RPTMask**：We propose a two-stage tracker, called RPTMask. The first stage is a base tracker responsible for locating the target bounding boxes. Specifically, we use ATOM [[16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)] to coarsely locate the target and update the tracking model and use RPT [[47](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68238-5_43)] to generate the target bounding boxes. In the second stage, following STMVOS [[51](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9008790/)], we design a mask generation network to generate the target masks. First, only the first frame is set to be the memory frame. Second, we improve the space-time memory reader in STMVOS with the kernel trick [[56](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58542-6_38)] and the top-k filtering [[10](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577550)] strategy. Third, following AlphaRefine [[67](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577854)], we add a refined box regression head paralleled to the mask decoder. The backbone in all models is ResNet50. --From [《VOT2021 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/400)<br />**核心：[ATOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)算法粗定位，[RPT](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68238-5_43)算法生成矩形框，[STMVOS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9008790/)生成分割结果，[AlphaRefine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577854)再次修正结果。**|     
     | [**VOT2020**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2020/)  | RGBD | **ATCAIS**(Accurate Tracking by Category-Agnostic Instance Segmentation for RGBD Image)：The proposed tracker combines both instance segmentation and the depth information for accurate tracking. ATCAIS is based on the ATOM tracker and the HTC instance segmentation method which is re-trained in a category-agnostic manner. The instance segmentation results are used to detect background distractors and to re-fine the target bounding boxes to prevent drifting. The depth value is used to detect the target occlusion or disappearance and re-finding the target. --From [《VOT2020 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/384)<br />**核心：[ATOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)算法与[HTC](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954166)实例分割相融合。**|
     | [**VOT2020**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2020/)  | RGBT | **DFAT**(Decision Fusion Adaptive Tracker)：Decision Fusion Adaptive Tracker is based on Siamese structure. Firstly, the multi-layer deep features are extracted by Resnet-50. Then, multi-RPN module is employed to predict the central location with multi-layer deep features. Finally, an adaptive weight strategy for decision level fusion is utilized to generate the final result. In addition, the template features are updated by a linear template update strategy. --From [《VOT2020 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/384)<br />**核心：不同层次深度特征上应用RPN结构，再进行决策级融合。** |
     | [**VOT2020**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2020/)  | LT | **LTMU_B**(A Baseline Long-Term Tracker with Meta-Updater)：The tracker LTMU_B is a simplified version of LTMU [[11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)] and LTDSE with comparable performance adding a RPN-based regression network, a sliding-window based re-detection module and a complex mechanism for updating models and target re-localization. The short-term tracker LTMU_B contains two components. One is for target localization and based on DiMP algorithm [[5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)] using ResNet50 as the backbone network. The update of DiMP is controlled by meta-updater which is proposed by LTMU (https://github.com/Daikenan/LTMU). The second component is the SiamMask network [[74](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953931)] used for refining the bounding box after locating the centre of the target. It also takes the local search region as the input and outputs the tight bounding boxes of candidate proposals. For the verifier, we adopts MDNet network [[55](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01225-0_6)] which uses VGGM as the backbone and is pre-trained on ILSVRC VID dataset. The classification score is finally obtained by sending the tracking result’s feature to three fully connected layers. GlobalTrack [[26](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6758)] is utilised as the global detector. --From [《VOT2020 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/384)<br />**核心：[LTMU算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)，提出MU模块处理噪声样本更新问题，可适配于任何在线判决分类学习跟踪算法，发表于[CVPR2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)。**|
     | [**VOT2020**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2020/)  | RT | **AlphaRef**(Alpha-Refine)：We propose a simple yet powerful two-stage tracker, which consists of a robust base tracker (super-dimp) and an accurate refinement module named Alpha-Refine [[82](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02024)]. In the first stage, super-dimp robustly locates the target, generating an initial bounding box for the target. Then in the second stage, based on this result, Alpha-Refine crops a small search region to predict a high-quality mask for the tracked target. Alpha-Refine exploits pixel-wise correlation for fine feature aggregation, and uses non-local layer to capture global context informationBesides, Alpha-Refine also deploys a delicate mask prediction head [[60](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156406)] to generate high-quality masks. The complete code and trained models of Alpha-Refine will be released at github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/AlphaRefine. --From [《VOT2020 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/384)<br />**核心：[Alpha-Refine算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577854)，跟踪结果修正模块，类似缩小Search Region的SiamMask，用于两倍搜索区域，Pixel-wise卷积，Corner输出取代Box输出，Mask分支辅助。即插即用，可用于各类Tracker的结果优化，发表于CVPR2020。**|
     | [**VOT2020**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2020/)  | ST | **RPT**(Learning Point Set Representation for Siamese Visual Tracking)：RPT tracker is formulated with a two-stage structure. The first stage is composed with two parallel subnets, one for target estimation with RepPoints [[84](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9009032)] in an offline-trained embedding space, the other trained online to provide high robustness against distractors [[13](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)]. The online classification subnet is set to a lightweight 2-layer convolutional neural network. The target estimation head is constructed with Siamese-based feature extraction and matching. For the second stage, the set of RepPoints with highest confidence (i.e. online classification score) is fed into a modified D3S [[50](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157386)] to obtain the segmentation mask. A segmentation map is obtained by combining enhanced target location channel with target and background similarity channels. The backbone is ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet, while the target estimation head is trained using pairs of frames from YouTube-Bounding Box [[59](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100272)], COCO [[45](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48)] and ImageNet VID [[63](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y)] datasets. --From [《VOT2020 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/384)<br />**核心：[RPT算法](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68238-5_43)，预测点集而非目标框，综合了可形变卷积、RepPoints 检测、多层级卷积特征等思想，精度非常不错，但速度很慢。**|
     | [**VOT2019**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/)  | RGBD | **SiamDW-D**(Online Deeper and Wider Siamese Networks for RGBD Visual Tracking)：SiamDW-D is a long-term tracker which mainly addresses the problems of target appearance variations, and frequent disappearance and re-appearance of target objects. It contains three parts, i.e. a main tracker, a re-detection module, and a multi-template matching module. The main tracker is based on [[109](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953458)], and further equips it with an online updating model, similar to [[16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466), [75](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780834)]. The re-detection module is triggered when the main tracker is not confident on its predictions. However, in some cases, the confidence of main tracker is not reliable for re-detection module triggering, therefore we introduce a multi-template matching module. It matches the unreliable tracking results with history templates, and outputs a more reliable estimation. Moreover, the depth information is also used to estimate the disappearance of target objects. Code is available at https://github.com/researchmm/VOT2019. For more information see the short-term tracker from the same group (A.39). --From [《VOT2019 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/375)<br />**核心：[SiamDW算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953458)，非常细致的Siamese Tracking讨论，发表于CVPR2019。**|
     | [**VOT2019**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/)  | RGBT | **mfDiMP**(Multi-modal fusion for end-to-end RGB-T tracking)：The mfDiMP tracker contains an end-to-end tracking framework for fusing the RGB and TIR modalities in RGB-T tracking [[107](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9022263)]. The baseline tracker is DiMP (Discriminative Model Prediction) [[8](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)], which employs a carefully designed target prediction network trained end-to-end using a discriminative loss. The mfDiMP tracker fuses modalities at the feature level on both the IoU predictor and the model predictor of DiMP [[107](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9022263)].--From [《VOT2019 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/375)<br />**核心：[Dimp算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9010649)结合多模态特征即为[mfDiMP算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/902226)，上述两个工作分别发表于ICCV2019Main Conference和Workshop。**|
     | [**VOT2019**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/)  | LT | **LT-DSE**(long-term tracking by diving videos into successive short episodes)：The tracker LT-DSE divides each long-term sequence into several short episodes and tracks the target in each episode using short-term tracking techniques. If the target disappears, the image-wide re-detection outputs the possible location and size of the target. The tracker crops the local search region and sends it to the RPN based regression network. Then, the candidate proposals from the regression network will be scored by the online learned verifier. The candidate with the maximum score will be regarded as the target and the tracker conducts short-term tracking which contains two components. One is for target localization based on ATOM algorithm [[16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)]. It uses ResNet18 as the backbone network and adds two convolutional layers above it. The other component is the SiamMask network [[96](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953931)] used for refining the bounding box after locating the centre of the target. For the verifier RT-MDNet network [[42](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01225-0_6)] is used as backbone and is pre-trained on ILSVRC VID dataset. The architecture of the region-proposal network is based on [[108](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04320)]. The network is trained using LaSOT dataset [[24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954084)] and ILSVRC image detection dataset. --From [《VOT2019 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/375)<br />**核心：[MBMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04320)算法全局重找回，[ATOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)算法局部跟踪，[RT-MDNet](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01225-0_6)验证跟踪结果判断切换，[SiamMask](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953931)修正跟踪结果。比较工程化的算法，随重新梳理为[LTMU](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)算法，发表于[CVPR2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156764)。** |
     | [**VOT2019**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/)  | RT | **SiamMargin**(Discriminative Siamese Embedding for Object Tracking)：SiamMargin is based on the SiamRPN++[58] algorithm and it learns discriminative embedding features in Siamese networks for object tracking. In the training stage, a discrimination loss is added to the embedding layer which imposed a margin to the decision boundary to encourage learning discriminative embeddings. The discriminative embedding is offline learned in the training phase, so it keeps the high speed of Siamese RPN. In the inference stage we exploit an online updating method with ROIAlign for Siamese networks based trackers. The template feature of the object in current frame is obtained by ROIAlign from features of the current search region. Then, the template feature is updated via a moving average strategy. The discriminative embedding features are leveraged to accommodate the appearance change with properly online updating. --From [《VOT2019 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/375)<br />**核心：[SiamRPN++算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954116)。**|
     | [**VOT2019**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/)  | ST | **ATP**(Accurate Tracking by Progressively refining) : We improve the tracking accuracy by progressively refining the target estimation. The process consists of three stages. At the first stage, we adopt the ATOM tracker [[16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)] to estimate the axis-aligned target position. At the second stage, we crop out an image patch centred on the estimated target and feed it into a segmentation network. Specifically, SiamMask [[96](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953931)] is used. At the third stage, a rotated bounding box is generated from the segmentation. --From [《VOT2019 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/375)<br />**核心：[ATOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953466)算法粗定位，[SiamMask](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8953931)算法精修正，上述两个算法均发表于CVPR2019。**|
     | [**VOT2018**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2018/)  | LT | **MBMD**( MobileNet based tracking by detection algorithm)：The proposed tracker consists of a bounding box regression network and a verifier network. The regression network regresses the target object’s bounding box in a search region given the target in the first frame. Its outputs are several candidate boxes and each box’s reliability is evaluated by the verifier todetermine the predicted target box. If the predicted scores of both networks are below the thresholds, the tracker searches the target in the whole image. The regression network uses SSD-MobileNet architecture [[35](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861),[52](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2)] and its parameters are fixed during online tracking. The verifier is similar to MDNet [[64](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Nam_Learning_Multi-Domain_Convolutional_CVPR_2016_paper.html)] and is implemented by VGGM pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset. The last three layers’ parameters of the verifier are updated online to filter the distractors for the tracker. --From [《VOT2018 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/365)<br />**核心：[MBMD算法](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04320)，滑动窗搜索+类SiamRPN回归+MDNet验证，但速度慢。改进算法[SPLT](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Yan_Skimming-Perusal_Tracking_A_Framework_for_Real-Time_and_Robust_Long-Term_Tracking_ICCV_2019_paper.html)精度类似，速度可达到实时，发表于[ICCV2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Yan_Skimming-Perusal_Tracking_A_Framework_for_Real-Time_and_Robust_Long-Term_Tracking_ICCV_2019_paper.html)。** |
     | [**VOT2018**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2018/)  | RT | **SiamRPN**(High Performance Visual Tracking with Siamese Region Proposal Network)：The tracker SiamRPN consists of a Siamese sub-network for feature extraction and a region proposal sub-network including the classification branch and regression branch. In the inference phase, the proposed framework is formulated as a local one-shot detection task. The template branch of the Siamese subnetwork is pre-computed while correlation layers are formulated as convolution layers to perform online tracking [[48](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8579033)]. What is more, SiamRPN introduces an effective sampling strategy to control the imbalanced sample distribution and make the model focus on the semantic distractors [[102](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01240-3_7)]. --From [《VOT2018 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/365)<br />**核心：[SiamRPN跟踪框架](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8579033)，Siamese网络特征提取，互相关融合模板与搜索区域，RPN生成候选，分类回归头输出目标位置，发表于[CVPR2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8579033)。** |     
     | [**VOT2018**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2018/)  | ST | **MFT**(Multi-solution Fusion for Visual Tracking)：MFT tracker is based on correlation filtering algorithm. Firstly, different multi-resolution features with continuous convolution operator [[15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100216)] are combined. Secondly, in order to improve the robustness a multi-solution using different features is trained and multi-solutions are optimally fused to predict the target location. Lastly, different combinations of Res50, SE-Res50, Hog, and CN features are applied to the different tracking situations. --From [《VOT2018 Report》](https://prints.vicos.si/publications/365)<br />**核心：相关滤波结合多种深浅层特征。** |
     | [**VOT2017**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2017/)  | TIR | **DSLT**(Dense Structural Learning based Tracker)：DSLT extends Struck with the ability to learn from dense samples and high dimensional features. DSLT runs in a simple tracking by detection mode, with no scale adaptation and occlusion handling. Compared to our initial work [[79](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865517301654)], the feature representation in DSLT consists of 28D HOG features computed without block normalization as well as a 1D motion feature which is simply the absolute difference between consecutive frames. The search range is also set larger to account for faster motion and to get more training samples. --From [《VOT2017 Report》](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w28/Kristan_The_Visual_Object_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)<br />**核心：[DSLT算法](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865517301654)，密集采样，Structured SVM和相关滤波相结合，发表于[PRL2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865517301654)。** | 
     | [**VOT2017**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2017/)  | RT | **SiamFC**(Fully-Convolutional Siamese Network)：SiamFC [[5](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48881-3_56)] applies a fully-convolutional Siamese network trained to locate an exemplar image within a larger search image. The network is fully convolutional with respect to the search image: dense and efficient slidingwindow evaluation is achieved with a bilinear layer that computes the cross-correlation of two inputs. The deep conv-net is trained offline on the ILSVRC VID dataset [[56](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y)] to address a general similarity learning problem. This similarity function is then used within a simplistic tracking algorithm. The architecture of the conv-net resembles ‘AlexNet’ [[34](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html)].

The proposed tracker employs a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on ILSVRC15 [[56](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y)] video dataset by the introduced learning framework in [[23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8291524)]. This framework is designed for correlation filter formulation in [[13](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2014/papers/paper038/index.html)]. To learn features, convolutional layers of VGGM-2048 network [[10](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2014/papers/paper054/index.html)], which is trained on [18], with an extra convolutional layer is fine-tuned on ILSVRC15 dataset. The first, fifth and sixth convolutional layers of the learned network, HOG [[47](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1467360)] and Colour Names (CN) [[65](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4982667)] are integrated to the tracker of [[17](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46454-1_29)].

It generates a small number of ‘high-quality’ proposals by a novel instance-specific objectness measure and evaluates them against the object model that can be adopted from an existing tracking-by-detection approach as a core tracker. During the tracking process, it updates the object model concentrating on hard false-positives supplied by the proposals, which help suppressing distractors caused by difficult background clutters, and learns how to re-rank proposals according to the object model. Since the number of hypotheses the core tracker evaluates is reduced significantly, richer object descriptors and stronger detectors can be used. More details can be found in [[25](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780477)]. --From [《VOT-TIR2016 Report》](https://data.votchallenge.net/vot2016/presentations/vot_tir_2016_paper.pdf)<br />**核心：[EBT算法](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780477)，Edge Box提取全局Proposal，在线更新Structured SVM分类，发表于[CVPR2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780477)。**  |

TCNN tracker consists of two main components, state estimation and model update. When a new frame is given, candidate samples around the target state estimated in the previous frame are drawn, and the likelihood of each sample based on the weighted average of the scores from multiple CNNs is computed. The weight of each CNN is determined by the reliability of the path along which the CNN has been updated in the tree structure. The target state in the current frame is estimated by finding the candidate with the maximum likelihood. After tracking a predefined number of frames, a new CNN is derived from an existing one, which has the highest weight among the contributing CNNs to target state estimation.-From [《VOT2016 Report》](https://data.votchallenge.net/vot2016/presentations/vot_2016_paper.pdf)<br />**核心：[TCNN算法](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07242)，稀疏候选采样，树结构集成CNN分类及在线更新。**  |

Firstly, we propose a set of candidate object locations computed by tracking-by-detection framework [[35](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6619152/)], where we use the frame as is and rotate them according to the ground truth annotation in the initial frame if applicable. Secondly, we determine the best candidate as the tracking result by two cues: detection confidence score and an objectness measure computed with edges [[48](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_26)]. Note that the full version of our tracker uses additional proposals and motion boundaries calculated with optical flow. But it is not included in this submission due to the computational cost of the optical flow method.

     | [**VOT2015**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2015/)  | ST | **MDNet**(Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker)：MDNet tracker represents the target object using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). MDNet pre-trains the CNN using a set of videos with tracking ground-truth annotations to obtain a generic representation for an arbitrary new sequence. The network is composed of two partsshared layers and domain specific layers, where domains correspond to individual tracking sequences and each domain has a separate branch for binary classification. After training, a generic representation in the shared layers across all domains is obtained. The tracking is performed by sampling target candidates around the previous target state, evaluating them on the CNN, and identifying the sample with the maximum score.

     | [**VOT2014**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2014/)  | ST | **DSST**(Discriminative Scale Space Tracker)：The Discriminative Scale Space Tracker (DSST) [[14](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2014/papers/paper038/index.html)]  extends the Minimum Output Sum of Squared Errors (MOSSE) tracker [[5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5539960/)] with robust scale estimation. The MOSSE tracker works by training a discriminative correlation filter on a set of observed sample grey scale patches. This correlation filter is then applied to estimate the target translation in the next frame. The DSST additionally learns a one-dimensional discriminative scale filter, that is used to estimate the target size. For the translation filter, the intensity features employed in the MOSSE tracker is combined with a pixel-dense representation of HOG-features.  --From [《VOT2014 Report》](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2014/download/vot_2014_paper.pdf)<br /> **核心：相关滤波算法[DSST](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2014/papers/paper038/index.html)，发表于[BMVC2014](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2014/papers/paper038/index.html)。**|
     | [**VOT2013**](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2013/)  | ST | **PLT**(Single scale pixel based LUT tracker)：PLT runs a classifier at a fixed single scale for each test image, to determine the top scoring bounding box which is then the result of object detection. The classifier uses a binary feature vector constructed from color, grayscale and gradient information. To select a small set of discriminative features, an online sparse structural SVM [[20](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6126251)] is used. Since the object can be non-rigid and the bounding box may be noisy, not all pixels in the bounding box belong to the object. Hence, a probabilistic object-background segmentation mask from color histograms is created and used to weight the features during SVM training. The resulting weighted and convex problem can be solved in three steps: (i) compute the probability that a pixel belongs to the objectby using its color. (ii) solve the original non-sparse structural SVM and (iii) shrink the solution [[21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6248061)], i.e. features with smallest values are discarded. Since the feature vector is binary, the linear classifier can be implemented as a lookup table for fast speed.  --From [《VOT2013 Report》](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2013/Download/vot_2013_paper.pdf) <br /> **核心：在线结构SVM分类器，[Struck](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6126251)跟踪算法，发表于[CVPR2011](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6126251)。**|
